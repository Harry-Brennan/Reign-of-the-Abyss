Reign of the Abyss is a couch Co-op Diablo-inspired isometric style focused on magic combat as well as melee combat with various different characters to choose from. 

The enemies you encounter and battle have formed alliances and will also attack other factions within the game so watch out for stray spells from these battles. Levels will end with a big boss battle combining various aspects of enemies you encounter throughout the level and will require teamwork from all of the players.

With a deep magic system at your disposal with each spell feeling and interacting with the world and enemies in different ways due to various different characteristics that each spell can have you will have multiple different ways to approach each encounter.

Status effects and a variety of spell characteristics will ensure that both the ranged and melee combat is deep and can be combined by players to create interesting experiences and unique situations, by ensuring that orthogonal design is implemented modularly.
